## About
In this assignment, we are asked to build a Website which helps entering data for different cocktail recipes and share the ideas with other user.

The application consists of different screens which make it easy to input the data.
Each screen contains means to input data in the most comfortable way, that the user should not have to type information which could already be prefilled.
For example, there is a widget for entering the date of birth.

## Content of the GitHub Repository
Files for the final version; they should be tagged with an adequate name like "final version", "last final version","new final version" :-) ,.... otherwise we take the last commit of the master branch
Installation instructions (README.md) with all vital information for the setup. (Very important !!!)
Don' forget: Also include all SQL-Scripts needed for adding test data (only if necessary)

## Getting Started

The first step was to think about the idea to create a Website which makes it possible for users to inscribe it's personal creations of cocktails in the easiest way and to store it in a database.
Primarily we established a concept which includes contents like design, functionality, task distribution, and other technical details or project management questions.
Afterwards we talked about the most important tasks (preparing the Views, implementing the database etc.) and the time management. Furthermore we have to use gitHubthe, which
makes it easier for all team members to interact with each other.
